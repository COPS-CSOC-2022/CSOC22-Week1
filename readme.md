# CSOC'22 Week 1 : Hangman Game
For this week's assignment, I have developed the Hangman game in accordance to the given tasks.

## Deployment
The site is deployed on Github pages at [Hangman](https://eshaanagg.github.io/CSOC22-Week1/).

## Features and Task Details

-  **1.** Implemented Hangman game. Used a random word generator to get new words in each game (from a predefined list of words).
-  **2.** Made multiple levels of the game. Each level has different lives for each user, and even the length of the word they have to guess changes to make it more challenging.
-  **3.** Added a timer so that users can keep track of how fast they can solve the challenges.
-  **4.** Implemented a high score page to view the previous scores. All the high scores are logged in which the cummlative score (i.e. the total score of the longest streak you had) and the time taken to achieve the said streak.
-  **5.** Implemented hints for users, by showing a few letters when the user needs them. A buzzer sound is also played (which can be toggled on and off).
-  **6.** A shake-type feedback when selected a wrong letter for players. 
-  **7.** Option to include or exclude zero scores in the leaderboard.
